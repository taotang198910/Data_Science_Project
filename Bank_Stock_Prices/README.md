### Introduction
In this project we focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices of several banks, and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis(2007-2008) all the way to early 2016.
This project is just meant to practice your visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.
In this project,I preferred visualization tools seaborn, matplotlib, plotly and cufflinks to do exploratory data analysis.
