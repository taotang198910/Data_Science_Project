### Introduction
In this project we focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices of several banks, and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis(2007-2008) all the way from 2006 to early 2016. I preferred visualization libraries matplotlib, seaborn and plotly in this project.
Bank info:
 * Bank of America (NYSE: BAC)
 * CitiGroup (NYSE:C)
 * Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)
 * JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM)
 * Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)
 * Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC)

This project is just meant to practice your visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.
