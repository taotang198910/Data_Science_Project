## Introduction
For this project, I have analyzed data from Kaggle. This data contains the names, job title, and compensation such as BasePay,OtherPay,Benefits,TotalPay,and TotalBenefitsPay for San Francisco city employees on an annual basis from 2011 to 2014.

This project involves taking messy data, then cleaning it up and doing analysis. Most party of this project are dealing with data cleaning. There are a few specific things what I have done in cleaning data:

  1. Filling in missing values
  2. Correcting erroneous datatype
  3. Normalizing values
  4. Standardizing categories
