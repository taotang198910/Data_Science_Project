## Introduction
The Zillow Rent Index is the median estimated monthly rental price for a given area, and covers multifamily, single family, condominium, and cooperative homes in Zillowâ€™s database, regardless of whether they are currently listed for rent. It is expressed in dollars and is seasonally adjusted. The Zillow Rent Index is published at the national, state, metro, county, city, neighborhood, and zip code levels.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

  1. What city has the highest and lowest median rental prices in the country?
  2. Which metropolitan area is the most expensive to live in?
  3. Where have rental prices increased in the past years and where have they remained the same?
